# Skills

Skills are reusable workflow patterns that encode FlowDeck's best practices into automated agents. Each skill is a self-contained unit with activation triggers, core principles, and step-by-step workflows.

## How to Activate

Skills activate in two ways:

- **Slash command**: Invoked via FlowDeck workflow commands (e.g., `/fd-task`, `/fd-review`, `/fd-execute`)
- **Auto-trigger**: FlowDeck hooks can invoke skills automatically based on context (e.g., `code-review` triggers after every code write, `deploy-check` before any deploy)

## Skill Taxonomy

### Planning & Requirements

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `plan-task` | Wave-structured task breakdown for multi-file features |
| `confidence-aware-planning` | Uncertainty-aware estimates — asks clarifying questions when confidence is low |
| `intent-translator` | Converts vague requests ("make it faster") into ranked implementation options with tradeoffs |
| `decision-trace` | Records why changes were made, what evidence was used, and what assumptions were made |

Source files live in `src/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in the project repository.

### Architecture

| `saga-architecture` | Distributed transaction pattern for microservices |
| `event-driven-architecture` | Event-based decoupling between services |
| `cqrs` | Command-query responsibility segregation for read/write optimization |

### Code Quality

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `code-review` | Systematic review with security checklist and severity-ranked findings |
| `tdd-workflow` | Red-green-refactor discipline with 80%+ coverage enforcement |
| `test-coverage` | Coverage enforcement with pass/fail thresholds |
| `test-gap-detector` | Identifies uncovered edge cases and suggests minimum viable test sets |
| `refactor-guide` | Safe refactoring patterns — one transformation per commit, tests stay green |

Source files live in `src/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in the project repository.

### Security

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|

| `postgres-patterns` | PostgreSQL schema, query, and indexing patterns |
| `django-patterns` | Django-specific patterns (ORM, views, middleware) |
| `django-tdd` | Django test-driven development workflow |

### Intelligence

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `failure-replay-engine` | Replays past failures to understand root causes |
| `regression-prediction` | Predicts which files are likely to break from a given change |
| `repo-memory-graph` | Builds a semantic graph of codebase knowledge |
| `decision-trace` | Records decision rationale for future review |

### Workflow

### More

Additional skills: `api-design`, `codebase-mapping`, `codebase-onboarding`, `code-tour`, `design-system-definition`, `multi-repo`.

## Skill File Structure

Each skill lives in `src/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: One-line description of what the skill does
origin: FlowDeck
---

# Skill Title

Step-by-step workflow description...
```

## Adding New Skills

1. Create `src/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with frontmatter
2. Add the skill path to the OpenCode plugin config in `src/index.ts`
3. Skills become available immediately — no rebuild required

## Authoring Thresholds (Token Budget)

Keep skill metadata tight — descriptions and bodies are loaded into context on every activation. The validator (`scripts/validate-skills.mjs`) enforces: `description` under 25 words (warning at 22), SKILL.md body under 400 lines (warning at 300).
