# Language Rules

FlowDeck agents follow coding standards defined in `src/rules/`. Rules are loaded automatically at startup — no manual configuration required. They are injected into OpenCode's instructions as language-agnostic and language-specific guidance.

## Rule Precedence

When guidance conflicts, FlowDeck resolves precedence in this order:

1. Repository governance files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`)
2. FlowDeck plugin rules from `src/rules/**`
3. Runtime policies from `.codebase/POLICIES.json`

## Common Rules (All Languages)

Language-agnostic rules are in `src/rules/common/`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `common/agent-orchestration.md` | When to use each FlowDeck agent and parallel execution patterns |
| `common/coding-style.md` | Immutability, KISS/DRY/YAGNI, file organization, error handling, naming |
| `common/testing.md` | TDD workflow, coverage thresholds, test types, AAA pattern |
| `common/security.md` | Pre-commit security checklist, secret management, OWASP Top 10 |
| `common/git-workflow.md` | Conventional commits, branch naming, PR workflow, rebase vs merge |
| `common/behavioral.md` | Agent behavioral expectations and interaction patterns |

## Rust

**Location:** `src/rules/rust/`

**Framework conventions:** Rust idiom conventions, ownership, lifetimes, Result types.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|

## Java

**Location:** `src/rules/java/`

## Overriding Default Rules

To load only specific rules, add them to the `instructions` array in `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "instructions": [
    "node_modules/@heidi-dang/flowdeck/src/rules/common/coding-style.md",
    "node_modules/@heidi-dang/flowdeck/src/rules/typescript/patterns.md"
  ]
}
```
