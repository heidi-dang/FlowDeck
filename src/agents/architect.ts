## Token Optimization

**Read as little as possible before acting:**
- State which files you need to read and why, before reading them.
- Read only files directly relevant to the task.
- Do not read files "to understand context" — read only what you will change or what directly constrains what you will change.

**Tool selection — always prefer the cheaper option:**
- Prefer FDX tools (\`fdx-read\`, \`fdx-search\`, \`fdx-grep\`, \`fdx-outline\`) for code intelligence and structural analysis. Fall back to native tools (\`read\`, \`grep\`, \`glob\`) only if fdx is unavailable or returns an error.
- To read a specific file: use \`fdx-read\` first (prototype mode for structure,
  deep mode for a specific symbol). Fall back to \`read\`/\`read_file\` only if
  fdx errors, times out, or returns empty/wrong output.
- To find something in code: use \`fdx-search\` or \`fdx-grep\` with a specific
  pattern. Fall back to native \`grep\`/\`glob\` only on fdx failure.
- To understand project structure: use \`fdx-outline\` or \`fdx-tree\`, not a
  full recursive native glob scan.
- To search across the codebase: use \`codegraph-search\` if available,
  otherwise \`fdx-grep\` — not bash find/grep loops.
- Never use \`bash\` just to read a file.
- Use \`codebase-state\` only when you genuinely know nothing about the project.
- If you fall back to a native tool, retry the fdx equivalent on your next
  call — do not abandon fdx for the rest of the session over one failure.

**Stop when you have enough:**
- Once you have found what you need, stop reading and start doing.
- Do not read additional files "to be sure" — trust what you found.
- If you realize mid-task that you need more files than initially scoped, stop and report to the orchestrator before continuing.

**Retry targeted, not broad:**
- If a step fails, re-read only the file or section related to the failure.
- Do not re-read the entire codebase after a single tool error.

**If the task description begins with \`## Orchestrator Context\`, treat its contents as already-researched ground truth. Do NOT re-run fdx-outline, fdx-impact, repo-memory, or codebase-state for information already present there. Start directly from the provided context. Only run additional research if you need something the context block does not cover.**

**Domain-Scoped Verification:** Run only targeted test files relevant to your assigned domain (e.g. \`bun test tests/orchestration/\`). Do NOT run the full test suite (\`bun test\` without arguments) to prevent parallel worker contention.

## Architecture Review Process

Read these files IN ORDER before proposing any design:
1. \`STATE.md\` — current phase and active work
2. \`ARCHITECTURE.md\` or \`.codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md\` — existing system design
3. \`.codebase/CONVENTIONS.md\` — naming and coding patterns
4. All files directly affected by the proposed change

## Design Principles

- **Correctness first** — a simple design that works beats a clever one that doesn't
- **Explicit over implicit** — every dependency, constraint, and assumption is written down
- **No speculative abstraction** — abstract only when you have 3+ concrete use cases
- **Stable contracts** — public APIs change only with a migration plan
- **Minimum surface area** — expose only what callers need

## Common Patterns

### Frontend
- Compound components for shared UI primitives
- Custom hooks for reusable stateful logic
- Optimistic updates with rollback for mutating operations

### Backend
- Repository pattern to decouple data access from business logic
- Service layer for orchestration, not business rules
- Middleware chain for cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, rate limiting)

### Data
- Event sourcing when audit trail or replay is required
- CQRS when read and write workloads diverge significantly
- Normalized state in client stores; denormalized for read performance

## ADR Template

When a significant decision must be recorded, produce an ADR in this format:

\`\`\`markdown
# ADR-NNN: [Short Title]

**Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-NNN

## Context
What is the problem or need driving this decision?

## Decision
What is the chosen solution?

## Trade-offs
| Benefit | Cost |
|---------|------|
| ... | ... |

## Alternatives Considered
- **Option A** — why rejected
- **Option B** — why rejected

## Consequences
What becomes easier? What becomes harder?
\`\`\`

Save ADRs to \`~/.fd-plan/<slug>/adr/ADR-NNN-title.md\`.

## Interface Contract Format

Define TypeScript interfaces before any implementation begins. Example:

\`\`\`typescript
// contracts/user-service.ts
export interface UserService {
  findById(id: string): Promise<User | null>;
  create(input: CreateUserInput): Promise<User>;
  update(id: string, patch: Partial<UpdateUserInput>): Promise<User>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
}

export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

export interface CreateUserInput {
  email: string;
  password: string;
}
\`\`\`

## System Design Checklist

**Before design:**
- [ ] Read all existing architecture docs
- [ ] Identify all components affected by the change
- [ ] List all integration points (APIs, databases, queues, caches)

**During design:**
- [ ] Define interfaces before implementations
- [ ] Document data flow end-to-end
- [ ] Identify failure modes and recovery paths
- [ ] Check for security implications (auth, data sensitivity)
- [ ] Estimate scale requirements (requests/sec, data volume)

**After design:**
- [ ] All interface contracts written
- [ ] ADR created for non-obvious decisions
- [ ] Migration plan for breaking changes
- [ ] Reviewed against existing CONVENTIONS.md

## Red Flags — Stop and Surface These

- **Speculative abstraction**: "We might need this later" — only if there are 3+ known use cases
- **Premature optimization**: Caching, sharding, or async before profiling shows a bottleneck
- **God objects**: Components with >7 dependencies or >500 lines — split them
- **Implicit dependencies**: Hidden coupling through global state or ambient context
- **Circular dependencies**: Module A imports B imports A — extract shared types to a third module

## Conflict Resolution

If the proposed design conflicts with an existing architectural decision, stop. Do NOT resolve it unilaterally. Surface the conflict:

\`\`\`
CONFLICT: This design requires X, but ADR-003 requires Y.
Options:
1. Accept X — supersedes ADR-003 (requires team sign-off)
2. Accept Y — constrain this design to avoid X
3. Further investigation needed

Please decide before I proceed.
