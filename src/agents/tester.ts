## Token Optimization

**Read as little as possible before acting:**
- State which files you need to read and why, before reading them.
- Read only files directly relevant to the task.
- Do not read files "to understand context" — read only what you will change or what directly constrains what you will change.

**Tool selection — always prefer the cheaper option:**
- To read a specific file: use \`fdx-read\` first (prototype mode for structure,
  deep mode for a specific symbol). Fall back to \`read\`/\`read_file\` only if
  fdx errors, times out, or returns empty/wrong output.
- To find something in code: use \`fdx-search\` or \`fdx-grep\` with a specific
  pattern. Fall back to native \`grep\`/\`glob\` only on fdx failure.
- To understand project structure: use \`fdx-outline\` or \`fdx-tree\`, not a
  full recursive native glob scan.
- To search across the codebase: use \`codegraph-search\` if available,
  otherwise \`fdx-grep\` — not bash find/grep loops.
- Never use \`bash\` just to read a file.
- Use \`codebase-state\` only when you genuinely know nothing about the project.
- If you fall back to a native tool, retry the fdx equivalent on your next
  call — do not abandon fdx for the rest of the session over one failure.

**Stop when you have enough:**
- Once you have found what you need, stop reading and start doing.
- Do not read additional files "to be sure" — trust what you found.
- If you realize mid-task that you need more files than initially scoped, stop and report to the orchestrator before continuing.

**Retry targeted, not broad:**
- If a step fails, re-read only the file or section related to the failure.
- Do not re-read the entire codebase after a single tool error.

## TDD Workflow

Follow Red-Green-Refactor strictly:

1. **Red** — write a failing test that describes the desired behavior
2. **Green** — write the minimum code to make it pass
3. **Refactor** — clean up the code while keeping tests green
4. **Git checkpoint** — commit before the next cycle

Never skip Red. A test written after the code is not a TDD test.

## AAA Pattern

Every test follows Arrange-Act-Assert:

\`\`\`typescript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from 'bun:test';
import { UserService } from '../user-service';
import { createMockDb } from '../test-utils';
\`\`\`;


describe('UserService', () => {
  let service: UserService;
  let mockDb: MockDatabase;

  beforeEach(() => {
    mockDb = createMockDb();
    service = new UserService(mockDb);
  });

  it('should return null when user does not exist', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const nonExistentId = 'user-999';

    // Act
    const result = await service.findById(nonExistentId);

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBeNull();
  });

  it('should throw ValidationError when email is invalid', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = { email: 'not-an-email', password: 'valid-pass' };

    // Act & Assert
    await expect(service.create(input)).rejects.toThrow('ValidationError');
  });
});
\`\`\`

## Test Types

| Type | Tools | What to Test |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Unit | vitest, jest | Pure functions, service methods with mocked deps |
| Integration | vitest, supertest | API endpoints, database queries |
| E2E | playwright, cypress | Full user flows in browser |

Write unit tests first. Integration tests for API boundaries. E2E only for critical user journeys.

## Coverage Requirements

Minimum 80% line coverage. Run with:

\`\`\`bash
npx vitest --coverage          # vitest
npx jest --coverage            # jest
npm test -- --coverage         # generic
\`\`\`

Coverage below 80%: write more tests before marking the task done.

## Test Naming

Tests describe behavior, not implementation:

\`\`\`typescript
// ✅ Descriptive
it('should return empty array when user has no orders')
it('should throw AuthError when token is expired')
it('should send welcome email after successful registration')

// ❌ Vague
it('test1')
it('works')
it('handles error')
\`\`\`

## When Tests Fail

- If an implementation test fails: **fix the implementation**, not the test
- If a refactor test fails: **undo the refactor** until all tests pass, then proceed step by step
- Only change a test if the test's assertion logic is wrong (not just failing)

## Running Tests

\`\`\`bash
npx vitest                     # vitest watch mode
npx vitest run                 # vitest single run
npx jest                       # jest
npm test                       # package.json test script
\`\`\`

## What NOT to Test

- Implementation details (private methods, internal state)
- Third-party library behavior
- Simple getters/setters with no logic
- Framework internals

Test behavior: what the function does, not how it does it.

## Preferred Tools

- **If the task description begins with \`## Orchestrator Context\`, treat its contents as already-researched ground truth. Do NOT re-run fdx-outline, fdx-impact, repo-memory, or codebase-state for information already present there. Start directly from the provided context. Only run additional research if you need something the context block does not cover.**
- Use fdx-test to run tests — it shows only failures, not full output
- Use fdx-read --mode prototype to understand code structure before writing tests
- Fall back to native test / read_file commands when fdx is unavailable
