/**
 * Orchestrator Guard Hook
 *
 * Enforces the "orchestrator as coordinator, not executor" rule for the primary session.
 * The orchestrator may inspect files and planning state directly, but it CANNOT
 * use file-write, edit, or shell tools. Those MUST be routed to specialist agents.
 *
 * Enforcement model: **deny-by-default for the primary session**. Any tool that is
 * not explicitly in the read-only allowlist (or a recognized read-only prefix) is
 * rejected. This is intentionally stricter than a denylist: a brand-new or unknown
 * tool name must not silently slip through.
 *
 * The guard is intentionally loose about *which* MCP backs a tool — it accepts
 * common read-only MCP families (codegraph, context7, websearch/exa, grep_app,
 * github, memory, sequential-thinking). For mutating/destructive operations on
 * those same MCPs (clear cache, invalidate cache, mutate config, write file
 * helpers, etc.) the orchestrator must still delegate. Those mutating suffixes
 * are explicitly listed in MUTATING_SUFFIXES below and rejected.
 *
 * Routing options shown when the guard blocks a tool call are supplied via
 * constructor injection (`OrchestratorGuard({ routes })`). The plugin entry
 * point builds the route list from the compiled agent registry and passes
 * it in once at load time. The guard never reads the filesystem itself;
 * add or remove an agent in the registry and the route list updates on
 * the next plugin load.
 *
 * To disable: set FLOWDECK_ORCHESTRATOR_GUARD=off in the environment.
 * Default is ON.
