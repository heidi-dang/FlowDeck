/**
 * Model Router Ghost-Name Regression Tests
 *
 * Covers:
 * - AGENT_TIER_MAP only contains real agent names (members of AGENT_NAMES)
 * - STAGE_AGENT_ALLOWLISTS only contains real agent names
 * - The "write-docs" stage allowlist routes to the real `writer` and
 *   `doc-updater` agents, not the stage name itself.
 *
 * Background: model-router.ts previously embedded several internal-service
 * or non-existent names (quick-router, question-guard, write-docs,
 * code-migrator, api-designer, db-designer, performance-profiler). Those
 * names are not in AGENT_NAMES, so the router could never have delegated
 * to them. This suite locks in the cleanup.
